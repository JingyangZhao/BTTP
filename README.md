# BTTP

This code solves the bipartite traveling tournament problem (BTTP).

Our source code is written by c++. When the number of teams satisfies $n = 16$, it can genetate a good schedule for BTTP.

The coordinates (latitude, longitude) of home venues of 32 teams (16 teams in the Western Conference and 16 teams in the Eastern Conference) are provided in locations.txt.

The 3-cycle construction with the swapping heuristics can be found in BTTP_3_cycle.cpp, and the 3-path construction with the swapping heuristics can be found in BTTP_3_path.cpp.

The brute-and-force algorithm for calculating the independent lower bound can be found in GetILB.cpp.

Our code mainly consists of three main parts: the well-known minimum weight perfect matching algorithm, the schedule algorithm, and the swapping heuristics.

You can run .cpp directly, the input has already been given, and the output includes the best found result generated by our algorithm with the a running time.

The output scheudle is displayed by a $2n\times 2n$ matrix, where the $i$-th row with $i&leq n$ (resp., $i&gq n$) indicates team $x_i$ (resp., $y_{i-n}$), the $j$-th column indicates the $j$-th day in the schedule, item $t_{i,j}$ (resp., $-t_{i,j}$) on $i$-th row and $j$-th column indicates team $t_i$ play an away (resp., home) game with team $t_{i,j}$.
