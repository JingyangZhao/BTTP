# BTTP

This code solves the bipartite traveling tournament problem (BTTP).

Our source code is written by c++. When the number of teams in each league satisfies $n = 16$, it can genetate a good schedule for BTTP.

① The 3-cycle construction with the swapping heuristics can be found in BTTP_3_cycle.cpp, and the 3-path construction with the swapping heuristics can be found in BTTP_3_path.cpp.

-- The input has already been given, and the output includes the best found result generated by our algorithm with the a running time.

-- The 16 teams in the Western Conference are labeled as {1,...,16}, and the 16 teams in the Eastern Conference are labeled as {17,...,32}.

-- The output schedule is displayed by a $2n\times 2n$ matrix, where the $i$-th row indicates team $t_i$, the $j$-th column indicates the $j$-th day in the schedule, the item $t_{i,j}$ (resp., $-t_{i,j}$) on the $i$-th row and $j$-th column indicates that team $t_i$ plays an away (resp., home) game with team $t_{i,j}$.

② The brute-and-force algorithm for calculating the independent lower bound can be found in GetILB.cpp.

-- The input has already been given, and the output is the value of the independent lower bound. It may take half an hour to calculate the independent lower bound.

③ The coordinates (latitude, longitude) of home venues of 32 teams (including 16 teams in the Western Conference and 16 teams in the Eastern Conference) are provided in locations.txt. 

-- The complete information (including team names, home venues, and home venue coordinates) of 16 teams in the Western Conference (numbered as 1,...,16) and 16 teams in the Eastern Conference (numbered as 17,...,32) is shown as follows.
